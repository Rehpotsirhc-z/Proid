* Introduction
Proid is a command-line tool that allows you to hide and show windows in X.

* Installation
The easiest way to build install proid is to use [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/][stack]]:

After you have installed stack, use the following command to compile from source:

#+begin_src sh
stack setup
stack install
#+end_src sh

~stack setup~ will automatically download the GHC compiler if you don't have it. ~stack install~ will install the proid executable into =~/.local/bin=, which you should add to your PATH.

* Usage
To hide the current window, you need to run ~proid hide~. If you run it in a terminal window, it will hide the terminal. It is recommended to bind the proid options to a keybinding so that it can work on any program.

Proid shows windows in the opposite order that you hid them in. It will show the most recently hid one first. You can show windows using ~proid show~.
